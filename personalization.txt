I chose the option text-dark because I like the aesthetic of the dark text standing out from the background color. The colors I chose was a light pink, light yellow, and black for the text. I think they work well together because the light colors bring out the black text in general.

CHOICE POINT #1: COLOR THEME
Option Chosen: [A, B, C, or D]
Explanation: [3-5 sentences about your color choices, why they work well together, and any accessibility considerations you made]
I chose option B because I would want to include colors that represent me. I think light colors work together because it brings the whole website together perfectly and visually. I made the left border light yellow for it to stand out, aswell as a light pink color when you click "go to canvas".
