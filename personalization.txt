I chose the option text-dark because I like the aesthetic of the dark text standing out from the background color. The colors I chose was a light pink, light yellow, and black for the text. I think they work well together because the light colors bring out the black text in general.

CHOICE POINT #1: COLOR THEME
Option Chosen: [A, B, C, or D]
Explanation: [3-5 sentences about your color choices, why they work well together, and any accessibility considerations you made]
I chose option B because I would want to include colors that represent me. I think light colors work together because it brings the whole website together perfectly and visually. I made the left border light yellow for it to stand out, aswell as a light pink color when you click "go to canvas".

I chose these classes because they seem interesting and i'm up to learning something new. I look most forward to learning about Earth science and the way the weather can affect the earth and many different ways. I think the most challenging class would be geometry because I am not the best at math and i've heard people say that it is a challenging class. These classes will help me reach my acedemic goals by staying on task and doing the work on time.

REFLECTION


What I Learned:
[Write 5-8 sentences reflecting on Module 1:
- What Bootstrap concepts made sense to you?
- What was most challenging?
- How do you feel about your CSS customization?
- What would you add to JagTrack in the future?
- How will you use this site for planning next quarter?]
The bootstrap concepts that made sense to me were the design concepts with the different types of rows and columns. The most challenging part was linking certain websites into the code and sometimes it wouldn't work. I feel pretty good about my CSS customization and I like that I made it simple with not too much going on. In the future, I would add more types of styles and lighter colors to make it more visually appealing. I will use this site for planning for next quarter by using it when I neesd study resources for a test.

Hours Spent: [3]


EXERCISE 2: GOOGLE CALENDAR INTEGRATION


Calendar Setup:
- Did you create a new calendar or use an existing one? [I created a new calendar.]
- How many Canvas iCal feeds did you add? [1]
- Did you add them individually by course or as one combined feed? [I added them as one combined feed.]


Reflection:
[Write 4-5 sentences about the calendar integration:
- How will this calendar help you stay organized?
- What challenges did you face getting it set up?
- Did you customize the calendar appearance? How?
- What view works best for you (month, week, agenda)?
- What other calendars might you add in the future?]
This calendar will help me stay organized by putting together all the assignments I need to get done by the deadline. I had a challenge that the calendar wouldn't show up on my website. I customized the calendars appearance by putting yellow borders to make it stand out. I think the month view works best for me because I can see what assignments I don't need to worry about and the assignments I need to do. I might add a calender for my future job to stay organized. 

EXERCISE 3: DARK/LIGHT MODE TOGGLE


Color Scheme Design:
[Write 5-7 sentences about your color choices:
- What colors did you choose for light mode? Why?
- What colors did you choose for dark mode? Why?
- How do your color choices reflect your personality or style?
- Did you use any color theory principles (complementary, analogous, etc.)?
- How did you ensure good contrast for accessibility?
- What tools did you use to help choose colors?
- Were there any colors you tried that didn't work? Why not?]
I chose colors like different shades of beige and pink for light mode because I like how well the colors go together simply. For dark mode, I chose colors like a dark pink and brown because I feel that those colors make the website stand out. My color choices reflect my style because my favorite color is pink and putting colors that go with that color make it put it all together. I didn'[t use color theory principles I just put similar shades or pink and brown. I ensured good contrast for accesibility by adding dark text to light backgrounds and light text to dark backgrounds. I used the random pallete generator to help me choose these colors. ]

Theme Preferences:
- Which theme do you prefer personally and why? [I prefer the dark them personally because it relaxes my eyes from a lighter theme.]
- When do you think dark mode is most useful? [I think dark mode is most useful when its at night time so you can see better without all the brightness.]
- Did you create any custom CSS for the toggle button? [I made the toggle button have an oval background with a light border.]


JavaScript Understanding:
[Write 4-5 sentences showing you understand the JavaScript code:
- In your own words, what does the JavaScript do?
- What is localStorage and why is it useful?
- What happens when you click the theme toggle button?
- Why does the theme preference persist when you reload the page?
- How might you use JavaScript in future projects?]
JavaScript makes things happen on a webpage without requiring it to reload. A localStorage alloqs websites to store small amounts of data directly on your device. When you click the theme toggle button the theme changes to either dark mode or light mode. The thenme preference persists when I reload the page because it uses localStorage. I might use JavaScript in future projects with coding in classes.
